## 1. Abstract
Legacy COBOL systems, while robust and proven, face mounting challenges:
- **Maintenance & Talent Shortage**: The pool of skilled COBOL developers is rapidly shrinking.
- **High Operational Costs**: COBOL systems incur significant maintenance fees and can limit integration with modern technologies.
- **Business Agility**: Modern applications require flexible, scalable, and interoperable platforms.

=> Migrating to Java addresses these challenges by leveraging modern IDEs, rich third‑party libraries, and agile methodologies


## 2. Introduction

### a. Status Quo:

#### **Current Migration Process**

#### **Limitation**
Some costly workload of the current Process
- Understanding COBOL source code
- Documentation & Translation between VN & JP
- Design System for JAVA system
- Developing on JAVA
- Build testcases & execute test base on the testcases (Manual & Automation)
- Communication
    - COBOL Engineer vs Business Analyst (JP)
    - Business Analyst (JP) vs Business Analyst (VN)
    - Technical Leader vs JAVA Engineer
    - Business Analyst (VN) vs Technical Leader/JAVA Engineer

=> We need automation. But the right question is: "How much automation should be implemented at any given time?

### b. State of AI Technology

#### How humans currently perform tasks?

- **System 1**: Fast, Intuitive base on patterns and experiences

- **System 2**: Slow, Analytical and Structured base on Planing, Reasoning and Optimization

=> So we can aware that:
- LLM is like "System 1"
- Agentic AI is like "System 2"

#### Limitation of current AI Agent System
- Target Goal is fuzzy (text and depend on LLM)
- Guardrail Goal is heuristic & fuzzy (also Depend on LLM)
    - In/out format validation
    - Security in AI
    - Hallucination detection
- Memory:
    - Short-term memory
    - Long-term memory
      - Entity Memory
      - Procedure Memory
     
## 3. Approaches:
### a. By Level of Automation
- Level 0: Manual Testing/Control – No automation; humans do everything. (**Current Process**) 
- Level 1: Basic Machine Learning Automation – Simple tasks are automated with ML support.
- Level 2: Partial Autonomy – Some tasks are automated with human supervision still needed.
- Level 3: Conditional Autonomy – AI takes charge in defined scenarios but with human fallback.
- Level 4: High Autonomy – Minimal human supervision; systems can handle complex tasks.
- Level 5: Full Autonomy – AI systems operate entirely independently.

### b. By Iterative Improvement
- Carefully encode human experience into system.
- Human provide feedback after each step & iteration.

## 4. Proposal solution & Roadmap:
### Proposal 1: AI as assistant & target to the most costly step of current process (**Cautious approach**)
- Goal
- How
- Rough estimation
    - Team
    - Cost 

### Proposal 2: Construct the current process (or part of it) as Agentic AI System & human supervise the progress (**Balanced approach**)
- Goal
- How
- Rough estimation
    - Team
    - Cost

### Proposal 3: Construct the current process (or part of it) as Agentic AI System & human verify the result (**Risky approach**)
- Goal
- How
- Rough estimation
    - Team
    - Cost
