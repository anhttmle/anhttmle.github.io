## 1. Abstract
Legacy COBOL systems, while robust and proven, face mounting challenges:
- **Maintenance & Talent Shortage**: The pool of skilled COBOL developers is rapidly shrinking.
- **High Operational Costs**: COBOL systems incur significant maintenance fees and can limit integration with modern technologies.
- **Business Agility**: Modern applications require flexible, scalable, and interoperable platforms.

=> Migrating to Java addresses these challenges by leveraging modern IDEs, rich thirdâ€‘party libraries, and agile methodologies


## 2. Introduction

### a. Status Quo:

#### **Current Migration Process**
![CodeReader-Manual Process drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05fe02fa-28bf-4c6d-8463-3264f8403eb9)

#### **Limitation**
Some costly workload of the current Process
- Understanding COBOL source code
- Documentation & Translation between VN & JP
- Design System for JAVA system
- Developing on JAVA
- Build testcases & execute test base on the testcases (Manual & Automation)
- Communication
    - COBOL Engineer vs Business Analyst (JP)
    - Business Analyst (JP) vs Business Analyst (VN)
    - Technical Leader vs JAVA Engineer
    - Business Analyst (VN) vs Technical Leader/JAVA Engineer

=> We need automation. But the right question is: "How much automation should be implemented at any given time?

### b. State of AI Technology

#### How humans currently perform tasks?

=> So we can aware that:
- LLM is like "System 1"
- Agentic AI is like "System 2"

#### Limitation of current AI Agent System
- Optimization Goal is fuzzy (Depend on LLM)
- Guardrail Goal is heuristic & fuzzy (also Depend on LLM)
    - In/out format validation
    - Security in AI
    - Hallucination detection
- Memory:
    - Short-term memory
    - Long-term memory
      - Entity Memory
      - Procedure Memory
     
## 3. Approaches:
### a. By Level of Automation
### b. By Iterative Improvement

## 4. Proposal solution & Roadmap:

## 5. Conclusion:
