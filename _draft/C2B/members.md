### Projects:
- Auto tuning firewall project
  - Developed a system that detect anomaly user behaviors for auto tuning WAF system.
  - Built a system that collected the data and detect bad requests to reduce false positive from traditional
  WAF (Web ApplicationFirewall).
  - Built a profile prototype and a model to tracked IP to rank users rating.
  - Reduced the human workforce in monitoring with an acceptable accuracy.
  - Applied quantization to the model to reduce the latency (support around 100 mils user requests per
  day).
  - Developed a DNS monitor module (tracking DNS to alert redirect site) using cron job.
  <br>
  **Product**: The application has integrated into the WAF and served more than 100 millions requests
  per day and denied around 100 to 1000 IP attackers per day
- Duplicate news and video detection
  - Designed an algorithm for video recommendation within the stipulated time. Used and applied tensor-
  flow as main application and flask for api. Worked with a 5-members research team for accomplishing
  this.
  - Increased the average time per devices by 5-10% and the total amounts of time by 13% by A/B
  testing.
  - Detected duplicate news cover 95% accuracy over a thousand news per day. This helped the moder-
  ators to reduced 80% working hours to check the duplicate ones.
  <br>
  **Product**: The features has applied in Mocha (app for Android and IOS) and Netnews.vn
- Tracking human workforce using vband
  - Worked with Human Activity Recognition (HAR) problems to helped the manager tracking em-
  ployees workforce. (https://news.microsoft.com/vi-vn/2021/09/06/vantix-ung-dung- tri-tue-nhan-tao-
  nang-cao-nang-suat-lao-dong/)
  - Used various timeseries model and approached to improved the accurate of the predictions. (Worked
  with RNN, CNN, ensemble models and XGBoost)
  - Worked with GPS correction problems for tracking worker in the construction (applied in VinHomes
  construction).
  - Used Kalman-Filtering algorithms to improved the roadmap for GPS and also reduced the GPS flash-
  ing, flicking problems.
  - Built a FastAPI demo for map tracking and dockerized the application into production.
  <br>
  **Product**: The application has served all the VinPearls and some VinHomes projects
