# Project Overview

This project aims to build a smart system that automates information extraction and defect detection from visual data, integrating machine learning modules with a front-end and API infrastructure. The project is divided into three main stages, with each stage having clearly defined objectives, tasks, and team responsibilities.

## 2. Modules
- **Information Extraction**: Extract structured information from images by recognizing layouts, text (OCR), and understanding the language context.
  - Layout Detection
    - Annotating: Labeling regions of interest for training.
    - Training/Tuning: Developing and adjusting the detection models.
    - Evaluating: Measuring performance and accuracy.
  - OCR
    - Augmenting: Enhance training data with various data augmentation techniques.
    - Training/Tuning: Optimize model parameters for better character recognition.
    - Evaluating: Validate the accuracy and robustness of the OCR engine.
  - Language Understanding
    - Prompt Engineering: Create and refine prompts for language models.
    - Evaluating: Assess output quality and refine based on results.
- **Defection Detection**: Detect product defects through computer vision by using weak-supervised learning & anomally detection methods.
  - Backbone Training: Train a robust backbone model that forms the foundation for feature extraction.
  - Weak-supervised Training: Leverage limited annotated data to further train detection capabilities.
  - Anomaly Detection: Identify abnormal patterns and outliers to spot defects effectively.
- **System Integration**: Develop a production-ready system by integrating AI components with front-end and back-end infrastructures.
  - UI Development: Build a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
  - API Development: Create secure and scalable APIs to connect the AI components with the UI and external applications.
  - Logging & Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring systems to ensure operational stability and facilitate troubleshooting.
