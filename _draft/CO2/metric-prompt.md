Context: 
- I am developing a system about 'waste sorting'. Which is named "NATURA" 
- System description: 
  - The system will work with other platforms (integrating by using my defined SDK) and also work as NATURA App/Web
  - User journey order
    - Integrated Platform (Logistic Platform, Resident Platform, Banking App, Fintech App)
    - Entry Point (Banner, Sorting Campaign, Reference from other users, Notification from Ads)
    - Onboarding Tutorial (Recycling Process Tutorial -> many Waste Category Separation Instructions)
    - Utilization
      - login (from other platform, NATURA's App/Web), anonymous login, sign up
      - refer other user to sign up, join, ...
      - open an tutorial about how a specific Waste Category Separation Instruction
      - submit sorted waste
      - tracking the waste
      - Joining a Campaign, Mission (will walk through Campaign/Mission Tutorial)
      - Viewing Dashboard which visualize Green Point user got after classify the waste and other metrics
      - Viewing Archivements which is rewarded after finish a Green Campaign or Green Mission
      - Exchange Green Point to Voucher, Donation, CC (a.k.a Carbon Certificate)
      - Make transaction in Green Market (exchange CC with other users, organizations,...)
      - and many more will be defined in the future
- Carbon Flow:
  - Carbon Id (user, bag of sorted waste) -> Trash
  - Trash -> Operators collecting
  - Operators collecting -> Logistic (Trash Vehicle)
  - Logistic -> Recycle Orgs (Company/Organization who use the sorted waste to build recycling Product)
  - Recycle Orgs -> Carbon Report (result of collecting sorted waste)
  - Carbon Report -> Carbon Reward (the result can be exchange to reward a.k.a Green Point)
  - Carbon Reward -> Green Action (some option doing by NATURA but decide by user earned the reward)
  - Green Action -> Carbon Id (user will got voucher, Donation reputation or money by doing the Green Action)

Task: I want to make documentation for the following metrics
- User Activity metrics
  - Green Point
  - Favourite Entry Point
    - From others platform
    - From anonymous
    - From NATURA App/Web
  - Recycling Process Tutorial skip at % (such as finish 5/10 steps -> 50%)
  - Waste Category Separation Instruction skip at % (for each category)
  - Campaign/Mission Tutorial skip at % (for each Campaign/Mission)
  - Archivement
    - Amount of category in kg/unit
    - Number/Value of reward that exchanged
      - Number/Value of Voucher
      - Number/Value of Donation
      - Number/Value of CC
    - Number/Value of Green Market transaction
  - Time metrics
    - Total active time (count for each day active)
    - Streak for sequence of active days
    - Velocity of sorting (like 5 kg per week)
    - Time on screen
      - NATURA App/Web
      - Tutorial type
- User Activity Window metrics (similar to User Activity metrics but for a period of time lately)
- Peer metrics (similar to User Activity metrics but compare among users)
  - Leaderboard (top 10, 100,... users)
  - User is doing better than % all users (like better than 30% users)
