## 1. Abstract
Legacy COBOL systems, while robust and proven, face mounting challenges:
- **Maintenance & Talent Shortage:** Declining pool of COBOL experts.
- **High Operational Costs:** Expensive maintenance and integration issues.
- **Business Agility:** Need for flexible, scalable, and interoperable systems.

Migrating to Java leverages modern IDEs, rich libraries, and agile methodologies to address these challenges.
