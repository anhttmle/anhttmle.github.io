# Toward human-intelligence (Yan Lecunn)

- AGI term was created to imply human-level intelligence but human intelligence is not general. We're specialized
- Term in Meta: AMI (Advance Machine Intelligence) -> pronounce "ami", mean "friend" in French
- AMI:
    - Learn
    - Remember    
    - Plan
    - Reason
    - Common Sense
    - Steerable
    - Safe
- We need Human-level AI for Intelligence Assistant
- In near future, all interact with Digital World is through:
    - AI Assistant: Voice, Vision, display, EMG (Electromyography - measures muscle response or electrical activity in response to a nerve's stimulation of the muscle)
- We need machine reach to Human-level intelligence
    - Machine can understand how the world works
        - Systems that can learn world models from sensory inputs
    - Machine that can remember
        - Large scale associative memories
    - Machine that can reason & plan
        - Can fulfill an objective
            - Inventing new solution to unseen problems
    - Machine that are controllable and safe
        - By design not by finetuning
- Inference as Optimization
    - Instead of providing answer by feed forward a bunch of layer, treat and inference request as an optimization request
    - Providing input to model, it will tell us what is compatible answer
    - Like Probabilistic Graphical Model, Bayesian Network
