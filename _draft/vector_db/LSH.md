How Does Locality-Sensitive Hashing Work?

LSH is based on the idea that similar vectors should be mapped to the same hash buckets with high probability, while dissimilar ones should not. The steps include:

    Hashing Data Points:
        Use a set of hash functions to map high-dimensional vectors to a lower-dimensional space.
        These functions ensure that similar vectors get similar hash values.

    Indexing Data Points:
        Store vectors in hash tables according to their computed hash values.

    Searching for Neighbors:
        Compute the hash of the query vector.
        Retrieve candidate vectors from the same bucket(s).
        Perform a refined search only within these candidates.
